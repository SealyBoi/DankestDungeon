In order to launch Dankest Dungeon, you must open your command prompt on your computer.

To do this on Windows, go to the bottom left search bar on your main screen. Type in "cmd" and hit enter.
To do this on Mac, open your Applications folder, then open Utilities, and double-click
on Terminal.

Next, you will type in a command (this varies for every user).

You can copy and paste the command here for easy access:
java -jar (location of file)

To find the location of your file, simply right click the DankestDungeon.jar application and select Properties.
You should find the location under the General tab.

NOTE: Your command should look something like this:
java -jar /User/name/OneDrive/Desktop/DankestDungeon/DankestDungeon.jar
